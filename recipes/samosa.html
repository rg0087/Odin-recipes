<p> 
Below is my complete step-by-step guide with photos for making the best Punjabi aloo samosa recipe from scratch.
</p>
 <p> 
You start by making the savory filling and pastry dough. Then assemble the samosa, fry, and enjoy with your favorite dipping sauces and chutneys!  
 </p>

 <li> <h2>Making the Potato Stuffing</h2>  </li>

 <ol>
<li>
 The first step to homemade samosa is to cook the potatoes and peas for the filling.
</li>     
<ul>
<li>
    To cook the potatoes and peas in a stovetop pressure cooker: Place 3 medium-sized whole potatoes (300 to 450 grams) and 2 to 2.5 cups water in a 3 or 4 litre pressure cooker. On top of the potatoes carefully set a small trivet and pressure cooker-safe bowl with ½ cup green peas. Pressure cook for 5 to 6 whistles or 7 to 8 minutes on medium to medium-high flame.
</li> 
<li>
    If using an Instant Pot: Place 3 medium-sized whole potatoes in the steel insert of a 6 quart IP. Add 2 cups water. Place a trivet on top of the potatoes, and on top of the trivet set a bowl with ½ cup of green peas. Pressure cook on high for 20 to 25 minutes.
</li>

</ul>

<li> 
    <p>For the stovetop pressure cooker, remove the lid after all the pressure falls in the cooker. For the Instant Pot, do a quick pressure release after 5 to 7 minutes. Check with a knife or fork to see if the potatoes are cooked well.
    </p>
    <p>The knife or fork should be able to slide through easily if the potatoes are cooked properly.
    </p>
    <p>If the potatoes are undercooked, then cook them for a few more minutes using the pressure cook function. Once done, drain the potatoes and peas in a colander and set aside to cool.
    </p>
